# LunchCode

**Your offline coding interview prep companion**

LunchCode is a lightweight, self-hosted platform for practicing coding interview problems **offline**. Inspired by NeetCode and LeetCode, it focuses on the **core 70-100 problem patterns** that frequently appear in interviews, helping candidates drill and internalize these concepts efficiently.

* 📊 **Feedback metrics**: Evaluate submissions with runtime and memory usage reports.
* 🌐 **Browser-based UI**: Access the interface easily in your local browser.
