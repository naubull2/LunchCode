  "description": "Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.\n\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "x = 122",
      "output": "false",
      "explanation": "122 reads as 221 from left to right and from right to left."
    },
    {
      "input": "x = -121",
      "output": "false",
      "explanation": "From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome."
    },
    {
      "input": "x = 10",
      "output": "false",
      "explanation": "Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome."
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1"
  ],
  "followUp": "Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?"
